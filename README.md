**Step 1: Create a React Project**
1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to create a React project named "my-app":
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

3. This will set up a basic React app with all necessary dependencies. After installation, navigate into the project folder:
```bash
cd my-app
```

**Step 3: Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**
1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Click on **File - Open Folder...** and navigate to the "my-app" folder.
3. Once opened, you'll see the full file structure, including files like `App.js` and `index.js`, which are central to your React application.

**Step 4: Run Your React Application**
1. In VS Code's integrated terminal, ensure you are in the project directory (`my-app`) and run:
```bash
npm start
```

2. This will start the development server, and your React app will open automatically in the default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

You should see the default "Welcome to React" page if everything is set up correctly!

**Step 5: Customize VS Code for React Development (Optional)**
For an enhanced development experience, consider adding these VS Code extensions:
• **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets**: For quickly adding React snippets.
• **Prettier - Code formatter**: Helps keep your code clean and consistent.
• **JavaScript (ES6) code snippets**: Adds additional useful snippets.

**Summary and Troubleshooting**
• **Installation Issues**: Ensure Node and npm are correctly installed.
• **Error Messages**: If `npm start` throws errors, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again.
